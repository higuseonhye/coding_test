Here's how the code works:

Get the length of the input string s and initialize the min_len variable to n, which is the maximum possible length of the compressed string.

For each possible length of substrings (from 1 to n), we compress the string using that length. 
- We start by setting the start variable to 0, the count variable to 1, and the compressed variable to an empty string.

We then iterate over the string in increments of the current length of substrings. 
- For each substring of length length, we check if the next substring of length length is the same as the current substring. 
- If they are the same, we increment the count variable. 
- If they are different, we add the current substring to the compressed string along with the count (if the count is greater than 1) and reset the count variable to 1.

After all substrings of length length have been processed, we add the remaining characters to the compressed string (if there are any).

We update the min_len variable to be the minimum length of the compressed string found so far.

After all possible lengths of substrings have been tried, we return min_len as the length of the shortest compressed string found.
