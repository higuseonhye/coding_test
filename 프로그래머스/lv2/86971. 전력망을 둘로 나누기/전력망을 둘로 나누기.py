"""
The solution function takes two arguments: an integer n (the number of nodes in the graph), and a list of wires representing the edges of the graph. 
Each wire is a tuple of two integers u and v representing an edge between nodes u and v. 
The function returns an integer representing the minimum absolute difference in the sizes of the two connected components of the graph after removing one wire.

The function works by trying each possible wire to remove and computing the size of the two connected components of the graph that remain after removing the wire. 
It then takes the absolute difference between the sizes of the two connected components and keeps track of the smallest such difference seen so far.

To compute the sizes of the connected components, the function performs a depth-first search on each node in the graph. 
It creates an adjacency list to represent the graph after removing the wire, 
    and initializes a list of boolean flags to indicate whether each node has been visited during the search. 
It then starts a search from each unvisited node, and keeps track of the number of nodes visited during the search. 
Once a search is complete, the function adds the size of the connected component to a list of component sizes.

After trying each possible wire to remove, the function returns the smallest absolute difference in component sizes seen.

You can test the function with the sample input provided in the problem:

n = 9
wires = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5],[4,6],[4,7],[7,8],[7,9]]
print(solution(n, wires))  # Output: 3

The output should be 3, since the smallest absolute difference in component sizes is obtained by removing the wire between nodes 4 and 5, 
    resulting in component sizes of 4 and 5.
