"""
The solution function takes five arguments: 
    an integer n (the number of nodes in the graph), 
    three integers s, a, and b (the starting node, the destination node for passenger A, and the destination node for passenger B, respectively), 
    and a list of fares representing the edges of the graph. 
Each fare is a tuple of three integers u, v, and w representing an edge between nodes u and v with weight w. 
The function returns an integer representing the minimum fare that must be paid for both passengers to reach their destinations, 
    assuming that they travel optimally and independently.

The function works by first creating an adjacency list to represent the graph, 
    and then computing the shortest distances between all pairs of nodes in the graph using Dijkstra's algorithm. 
It then initializes the answer with the direct fares from s to a and b, and tries each possible transfer node t to see if a better fare can be found. 
The total fare for each transfer node is computed as the sum of the fares from s to t, from t to a, and from t to b. 
The function returns the minimum fare seen.

You can test the function with the sample input provided in the problem:

n = 6
s = 4
a = 6
b = 2
fares = [[4, 1, 10], [3, 5, 24], [5, 6, 2], [3, 1, 41], [5, 1, 24], [4, 6, 50], [2, 4, 66], [2, 3, 22], [1, 6, 25]]

print(solution(n, s, a, b, fares))  # Output: 82
The output should be 82, since the optimal transfer node is node 5, resulting in 82.
