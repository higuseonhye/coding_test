"""
This code solves the problem of unlocking a lock with a given key in a 2D matrix.

Here's a brief overview of what the code does:

- rotate_a_matrix_by_90_degree(a): A helper function that takes a 2D matrix a and returns it rotated by 90 degrees.

- check(new_lock): A helper function that takes a 2D matrix new_lock and checks if the central portion of size (len(new_lock) // 3) x (len(new_lock) // 3) is all 1's.

- solution(key, lock): The main function that takes a 2D matrix key and a 2D matrix lock, and returns a boolean indicating whether the lock can be unlocked by the key.

1. Initializes some variables.

2. Copies the lock matrix into a larger matrix new_lock of size 3*n x 3*n with the central portion filled with the lock's values.

3. Loops through each of the 4 rotations of the key.

4. Loops through each position of the key in the new_lock matrix.

5. Adds the key to the corresponding portion of new_lock.

6. Checks if the central portion of new_lock is all 1's. If so, returns True.

7. Subtracts the key from the corresponding portion of new_lock.

8. Returns False if none of the rotations and positions of the key were able to unlock the lock.
