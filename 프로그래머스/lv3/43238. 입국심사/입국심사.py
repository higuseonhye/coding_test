"""
The solution function takes two arguments:

n : an integer representing the number of applicants
times : a list of integers representing the processing time for each immigration officer
The function first sorts the times list in ascending order. 
Then, it initializes the minimum and maximum time it can take to process all applicants. 
The minimum time is 1 because it takes at least 1 minute to process an applicant. 
The maximum time is n * times[-1] because the slowest immigration officer can process all applicants in n * times[-1] time.

The function then performs a binary search to find the minimum time required to process all applicants. In each iteration, 
    it calculates the mid time and counts the number of applicants that can be processed with the mid time. 
If the number of processed applicants is greater than or equal to n, 
    it means that we can process all applicants with the given mid time or less. 
So, we update the right bound to mid-1. 
Otherwise, the given time is not enough to process all applicants. 
So, we update the left bound to mid+1.

Finally, the function returns the minimum time required to process all applicants.
