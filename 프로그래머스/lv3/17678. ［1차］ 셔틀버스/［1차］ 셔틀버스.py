"""
First, we convert the timetable to minutes for easier processing. 
- We also sort the timetable in ascending order.

Then, we initialize variables for the first bus time and the last person's arrival time.

We loop through each bus and check how many people can get on the bus. 
- We keep track of the last person's arrival time as we iterate through the timetable.

If it's the last bus, we can take any available seat. 
- If there are no available seats, we return the last person's arrival time minus one minute (to ensure that we're not late). 
- Otherwise, we return the bus time.

If we haven't returned anything by the end of the loop, we return None (which should never happen).

Note: We use the %02d:%02d format string to ensure that the output has leading zeros for single-digit hours and minutes.
